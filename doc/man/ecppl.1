.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCecppl\fR is the language extractor for ecpp. Ecpp \- the template language used
with tntnet \- supports internationalized applications. In ecpp templates a tag
<i18n> changes the meaning of curly braces. A phrase, which is enclosed in curly
braces, can be translated. At runtime the phrase is looked up in a
language\-library. This mode can be quit with the tag </i18n>\&. Phrases must not
have newlines or tabs.

.PP
Every phrase, which is marked as translatable, is extracted with ecppl and
written to standard output or to a specified output\-filename line by line.
